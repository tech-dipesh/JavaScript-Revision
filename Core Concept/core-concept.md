Major variable are:
String, Number, and Boolean



The Variable Rules are:
can't use keywrod, or reserved words,
can't start with number
no special character than: $
= not allowed
; it mean end the instruction


# ; not necessary on js




The const is used when we sure that that we don't need to modify later:




# Data types on js:
Primitive data type mean that they're not object, and have no values, alsoo immutable, which value cnat be change:
Primitive:
string
number
null
undefined
boolean


Number Types:
  Whole Number:
    zero number
    natural Number
  Negative Number


Non Primitive:
Object
Array 
Function



 
 Text can have the single character to the entire string as you want.


 Single string for single quotes,: (''), double quotes: (""), backtick: (``)
 backtick also allow the template literals: (`${}`)
 Also can concat the string with: +




# I must have to initiliaze a const value, withotu initlize it cause the error.




Anonymous fucntion as as settimeout becomes a callback function.




Now whenever we do the callback, it'll be print a things that after return a result, if any other appear to printing those will be print first.
