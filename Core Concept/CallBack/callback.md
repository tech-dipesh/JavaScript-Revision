    which we can take a function and pass it to the another function, the pass function is calleld a callback function.


The callback function are very powerful, which they give us the whole asynchronous of the js.


When we pass a function to the setTimeOut is the callback function.


# When on the asynchrounous operation any call stack is called, after caling it'll be vanished and if any event stack is appeared it'll only appear on call stack after that time.




Add even listender take a lot of space, so if on the website there are lot of event, so we try to remove that element from the space so that website won't go slow.


The closure mean, do counter inside a event Listener, we can do with global variable, but it's not recommand, just wrap entire things to the function and call that function.
  Which mean the function is forming a closure with the outer scope.



On the callback hell mean callback inside callback which is the callback hell.


The callback hell solution is the promises.
