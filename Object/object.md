For storing a key value pair to group together we use a object.


For accessing a any object, we can use the either dot notation, or the bracket notation to access it.


console.log(University.topperName);
console.log(University['topperName']);

Dot product and the bracket notation.

For string define we can use bracket while on the other hand the dot product is useful.


when we check a typeof of the object it return the objec.t



delete list.name

For deleting a any key value pair.






On the reference value, when we copy any value or object, it copy the rerference, mean if we change teh original data it also reflect on the copied data,
it's due to it's pointing on the same memory both.

Also if we compare: == we're compare reference with the address not that data on the copied Data




For Accessing the inside object without . we also can use the function and this operator.





# For the iterate the object we use the for in approach.


#  The Object Literals help us to define the any variable with the same naming even outside object.



# on the object of the functional declaration we dont' need to write full function rather we can do:
let makeObject={
  doSomeMagic(){
    console.log("You're topper");
  }
}
Can work as a function.
