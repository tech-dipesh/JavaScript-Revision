unlike on teh other language, we only can store the same data type,
while on teh js, we can store any data type from the null to the undefined to object to the string




Can have the multiple lines as long there is not close bracket,
array can also hold the inside array.
The array type is the object.


Array is help us to store a multiple values to single variable and can access any element with the index.


Array type is the object.



The common array method are:
get the length: length
do stack style: push, pop
do queue style: shift, unshift,
Add or remove element on specific index:  
Convert STring: toString()
Sort the entire Array: sort



arr.splice(2, 3): Remove element from 2 to 3 next value


Array is also same as object work on reference 


Destructure can also do on the array.





on the array prototype, when we somethings write a array.protoType it can reusable on teh all of the other rest array.
