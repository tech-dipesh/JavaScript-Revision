The await keyword keyword is used when we've to get the data, so await will waits first to get that data

 # imp: but we must have to use teh async before the function start to use teh await to get the data from online or anywhere.



 Async await is specifically used where we're trying to get the data from online




 The bette way to handle is try catch block on the async await 


for the try catch block throw value ways:

     if(!Value.ok) throw new Error (`Value is doesn't exist ${Value.statusText}`)
